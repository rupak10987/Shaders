# Shaders
 In this repository I put some GLSL Shader codes,
 
 which I learnt throughout the opegl course.


<h1><b>Instructions</b></h1>

These codes can run on Visual Studio Codes with the "GLSL-CANVAS" and "GLSL Shader Support" extensions enabled.

The easy way is to cpy the code and paste it in online glsl editor. link down below.
